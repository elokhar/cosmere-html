            The structure and physics of the cosmere are the same as our own, but the main story of the cosmere occurs in a compact dwarf galaxy, meaning it has many fewer stars and systems than our galaxy. Time flows the same in the cosmere (except under special magical effects, such as Allomantic cadmium and bendalloy).

            There are ten primary planets in the cosmere, sometimes called Shardworlds, as the Shards of Adonalsium play major roles there. There are inhabited worlds with no Shards on them, and some planets may only have Splinters of a Shard on them. Planets without Shards are generally referred to "minor Shardworlds". On all cosmere planets, magic is called Investiture, a catch-all term for the various expressions of Adonalsium's magic. All magic we've seen has been derived from the Shard's--or Adonalsium's--power. Specific magic systems, like Allomancy or Surgebinding, are termed "manifestations of Investiture." On minor worlds, people don't utilize Investiture directly, and magic is more something people interact with through nature.

            The physical universe of the cosmere only tells one part of the story. In fact, there are three Realms of existence: the Physical Realm, the Cognitive Realm, and the Spiritual Realm that all coexist simultaneously, and everything has aspects in each of these Realms. Even planets themselves have souls. Investiture transcends all three of these Realms. The Cognitive Realm, including regions such as Shadesmar, allows for travel between cosmere planets. Also, there is something beyond the Three Realms, where people "pass on," which Shards can potentially touch, but Brandon does not wish to reveal anything about it.

            There are also other forces outside of things derived from Adonalsium. One is a force that opposes Adonalsium, which still exists, and some say there are "subtle forces" being manifest, separate from Adonalsium, perhaps referring to the God Beyond.
